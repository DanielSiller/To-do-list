# To-do List

Who has never needed to have a to-do list in the palm of their hand?

This tool helps you organize your tasks and sub-tasks, allowing you to create a task list and then share it via email with other people, who can collaborate by adding more tasks, completing them, or even removing them.

## Features

### Lists
-[ ] **Create List** 
You can create multiple task lists and share them with people, **but only the owner can delete or edit the list's name.**

### Tasks
Each list can have its respective tasks, and each task can be edited in the following ways:

- [ ] **Move the task into another task, transforming it into a subtask.**
- [ ] **Edit the task's name.**
- [ ] **Delete a task.**

### Subtask
Each task will have its subtasks, in which we can:
